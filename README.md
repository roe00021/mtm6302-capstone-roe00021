Part-3 Report:

I wanted to display as many eliments as possible using HTML and CSS so that the initial work was completed for part 3. 

I didn't run into any major problems. It was mostly trial and error with aligning elements to match the mockup.

I added 20rem margin-top to the extra buttons that arent supposed to be displayed on the initial page.

Mockup Design Decisions:

The idea behind this mockup is to create something with a minimalist approach to the design. 

Font:
I wanted to utilise a unique font but one that has similar properties to standard sans serif fonts which is why I chose to use 'Oswald'.

Colors:

I wanted to create a color pallet that could esily be adjusted with one single color. For example simply changing the main color from blue to red would be easy as the light blue could be replaced with light red and the grey could be replaced with a redish-gray. The whites and blacks also privide an easy method of changing the color pallet to suit a 'Dark Mode'.

Logo:
I wanted to create a fun name that revolves around the work Quiz. After some messing around I decided to create the brand 'QUIZIâ€¢PEDIA'. This is a fun way of combining the words 'Quiz' and 'Wikipedia'.

UI:
The idea behind the UI choices is to make the web and mobile applications extremely similar in regards to branding and view. Creating little to no difference when it comes to the UX on web or mobile.
